                Open Set is looking for a skilled front-end developer to help us
                build web projects ranging from interactive data visualizations
                to responsive websites to complex user interfaces. While the
                main responsibilities of this position will be implementing the
                front-end, the ideal candidate will have experience working up

                6 weeks and pays $10,000. A full-time position is a possibility
                at the end of the contract but is not guaranteed.
